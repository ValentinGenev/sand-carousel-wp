# Sand Carousel WP
This plugin creates custom post type named Slide that's displayed in the [Sand Carousel](https://github.com/ValentinGenev/sand-carousel).
**WARNING** the project is still in development.

## About
The carousels created with this plugin can be placed everywhere with the use of the plugin's shortcode:

```html
[sand_carousel group='slides-group-slug']
```

To create a carousel, one needs to create a post of the plugin's post type *Slides* and then assign it to a *Slides Group*. The newly  created Slides Group slug should be placed in the shortcode.

## To do
- Demo of the carousel;
- usage tutorial.
